Create a file called my_first_file_with_content in your directory. Update its size.

Size needs to be: 40.
How can a file be size of 40?
Each character (or letter) is 1, so you simply need to add 40 characters inside the file. ;-)

In order to print this information, use the command ls -l (command is ls and -l is one option).

Example00

$>ls -l
xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content
$>
We've replaced some values with x, it means they are not important at the moment. You can disregard them :)

Tips

$> is a very common way to represent a prompt.

How to read the above Example00:

You are in a shell (the $>) and you've executed the command ls -l.
It has printed: xxxxxxxxx  x xxxxx  xxxxx  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content
And the last line is reprinting the prompt ($>).
Tips
The terminal is the little box where you execute command at the bottom part of Docode.
