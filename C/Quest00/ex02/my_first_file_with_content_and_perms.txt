Create a file called my_first_file in your directory. Update its size THEN its permissions. (in this order: because you will be asked to remove the permission to WRITE to a file which will be problematic to add a content inside it ;-))

Size needs to be: 40 (be creative, here, how a file can have a size of 40...? :))
Permissions need to be: r--r-xr-x (Google chmod? :-))
In order to print this information, use the command ls -l (command is ls and -l is one option).

Example00

$>ls -l
-r--r-xr-x  1 login  group  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content_and_perms
$>
Tips

$> is a very common way to represent a prompt.

How to read the above Example00:

You are in a shell (the $>) and you've executed the command ls -l.
It has printed: -r--r-xr-x  1 login  group  40 May  25 14:30 my_first_file_with_content_and_perms
And the last line is reprinting the prompt ($>).
Tip

The terminal is the little box where you execute command at the bottom part of Docode.

Part 01
Once you’ve finished the previous steps, execute the following
command to create the file that will be submitted:

tar -cf my_first_file_with_content_and_perms.tar my_first_file_with_content_and_perms
Tip
To test if your exercise(s) is/are correct(s), you can execute the command gandalf in your terminal.
