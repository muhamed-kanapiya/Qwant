Time to Git!

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. @Wikipedia

Create a file with the word "content" as the actual content of the file (disturbing?!)
$>echo "content" > file
Add that file to the commit (feel free to Google what a commit is!)
$>git add file
Prepare the commit with a message (please find below an example of a commit message; you should provide an accurate message for each commit you will do during your software engineer's life)
$>git commit -m "I swear I will ALWAYS add a great message for my commits"
Push the commit
$>git push
Now we know you know how to use git. No excuses and ALWAYS PUSH YOUR WORK. :-)
