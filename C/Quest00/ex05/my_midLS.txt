It's time to write your first script. A script is a file which contains commands and you will execute it to run them. It's very useful to combine multiple commands. In this first script, you will only have one command.

In a my_midLS file, write a command line that will list all files and directories in your current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that includes double-dots), by order of time modified. Make sure directories' names are followed by a slash character.

$>cat my_midLS
#!/bin/sh

#ls -OPTIONSSS :-)
$>
Example of output:

$>chmod 755 my_midLS
$>mkdir dir00 dir01 dir02
$>touch file00 file01
$>./my_midLS
file01  file00  dir02/  dir01/  dir00/  my_midLS
$>
Tips
What has not been asked for should not be done!
man ls will be your friend!
You have to file the right combination of option to make the command ls to add the / at the end of each directories and sort the content by time ;-)

Git doesn't store empty directories, so you will need an additional step: for each directory, create a file without any content called: .gitkeep

Example

$>pwd
/home/docode/quest00/ex04
$>ls -lRa
